# Predicting-Financial-Crises

The pdf file will report all the results of this study. The dataset comes from the Schularick and Taylor and is covering 14 developed countries such as the United States or France and goes from 1870 to 2008. 

Study A: predicting the probability of a crisis using 5 lags of credit growth

Study B: predicting the probability of a crisis using all the features available in the dataset besides 'govass' which had more than 60\% missing data and we have added the credit growth

Processing 1: excluding world wars and their aftermaths (1914-1926 and 1939-1948) and excluding all observations with missing data

Processing 2: filling the missing data with interpolation in order to keep as much observations as possible
